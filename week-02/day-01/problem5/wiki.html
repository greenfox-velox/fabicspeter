          <p>Margaret Heafield Hamilton (born August 17, 1936)[1] is a computer
            scientist, systems engineer, and business owner. She was Director
            of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation
            Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for the Apollo
            space program.[2] In 1986, she became the founder and CEO of Hamilton
            Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was
            developed around the Universal Systems Language based on her
            paradigm of Development Before the Fact (DBTF) for systems and
            software design.[3]</p>
            <p>Hamilton has published over 130 papers, proceedings, and reports
               concerned with the 60 projects and six major programs in which
               she has been involved.</p>

               <h2>Early life[edit]</h2>
               <p>Margaret Heafield was born to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther
                 Heafield (n√©e Partington).[4] She graduated from Hancock High School
                 in 1954, and earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy
                 from Earlham College in 1958.[5] After graduation, she briefly taught
                 high school mathematics and French in order to support her husband while
                 he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard, but with the ultimate
                 goal of pursuing a graduate degree at a later time. She moved to Boston,
                 Massachusetts, with the intention of doing graduate study in abstract
                 mathematics at Brandeis University. In 1960 she took an interim position
                 at MIT to develop software for predicting weather on the LGP-30 and the
                 PDP-1 computers (at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC) for professor Edward
                 Norton Lorenz in the meteorology department.[1][6] At that time, computer
                 science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead,
                 programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.[2]</p>
                 <p>From 1961 to 1963, she worked on the SAGE Project at Lincoln Labs,
                    where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first
                    AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), to search for "unfriendly" aircraft; she
                    also wrote software for the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.</p>
                  <h2>SAGE Project[edit]</h2>
                  <p>An extension of Project Whirlwind, started by M.I.T., to create a computer
                    system that could predict weather systems and track their movements through
                    simulators; SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air
                    defense from potential Soviet attacks during the Cold War. For her part,
                    Hamilton described her duties as such,</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>What they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner,
                        was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure out
                        or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well. And
                        what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote
                        it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and
                        Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It
                        even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to
                        get it to work[7]</p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <p>It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the
                        position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.</p>
